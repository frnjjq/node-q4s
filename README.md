A node.js implementation of the Q4S protocol.

## Getting Started

The main components of this project are the Q4S server and the Q4S client. Those are served as modules to import to your own program. The use of those is shown in example programs under example folder. 

The server example shows a simple Q4S server. That server only logs the recieved messages. The Q4S client example does the same logging the ocurred events.

To know more about the Q4S protocol please visit the [official website](https://q4sprotocol.wordpress.com/). Or visit the [current Q4S draft in the IETF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aranda-dispatch-q4s/)

See docs and example programs for notes on how to use this project in a production system.

### Compatibility

This module is aimed to be compatible with current [nodejs LTS releases](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) from 8.x.

This module does not have production dependencies. So there is not associated security risks associated to third party modules.
